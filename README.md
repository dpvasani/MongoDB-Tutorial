## MongoDB

In the `mongodb` folder, you will find notes and resources related to MongoDB. These notes cover various topics such as installation, data modeling, querying, indexing, and more. Feel free to explore the `mongodb` folder to enhance your understanding of MongoDB.

## Mongoose

The `mongoose` folder contains notes and resources specifically related to Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. These notes cover Mongoose schema definition, CRUD operations, middleware, and other advanced features. If you're interested in using Mongoose to work with MongoDB in your Node.js applications, the `mongoose` folder will provide valuable insights.

## Code

In the `code` folder, you will find example code snippets that demonstrate various MongoDB and Mongoose operations. These code snippets are organized by topic and provide practical examples of how to perform common tasks with MongoDB and Mongoose.

To run the code samples, make sure you have MongoDB installed and configured on your machine. Then, navigate to the `code` folder and follow the instructions provided in each file.
